# Lynq Proxy

Soon, you'll be able to route Lynq analytics data through your own API endpoint. This proxy setup offers two key advantages:

1. Reduces DNS lookups to improve performance
2. Ensures reliable data collection by preventing ad blockers from blocking analytics requests

_This feature is currently under development. Stay tuned for updates on the release and implementation details._
