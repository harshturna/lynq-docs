# Custom Events

Track specific user interactions in your application using Lynq's custom events. The `track()` function lets you capture actions like button clicks, purchases, or form submissions.

## Basic Usage

First, ensure you've [set up Lynq tracking](/get-started/setup). Then use the following syntax to track events:

```js copy
lynq.track("login");
```

<Callout type="info">
  The `lynq` object is available globally on `window`, making it accessible
  throughout your code
</Callout>

## Adding Event Properties

Need to include additional details? Pass an object as the second argument:

```js copy
lynq.track("Subscription", { type: "Monthly" });
```

## Property Restrictions

Event properties must follow these rules:

- No nested objects or arrays
- Only accepts: `string`, `number`, `boolean`, and `null` values
