# Setting Up Website Tracking

Adding Lynq tracking to your website is a simple two-step process. Just add our tracking script to your site's HTML, and you'll start seeing analytics data right away.

## Installation

Add the following code to the `<head>` section of your root HTML file:

```js copy /"YOUR DOMAIN ID"/
<script>
!function(){"use strict";window.lynq=window.lynq||{track:function(n,e){(window.lynqQueue=window.lynqQueue||[]).push({name:n,properties:e,eventId:crypto.randomUUID()})}}}();
</script>

<script
  async
  src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/harshturna/lynq-js@v1.0.6/dist/lynq.min.js"
  data-domain="YOUR DOMAIN ID"
  data-script-id="lynq"
></script>
```

<Callout type="info">You can find your Domain ID in the Lynq Dashboard</Callout>

## What's Next?

That's it! Once you've added the script, Lynq will automatically begin tracking your website analytics. No additional configuration is required - you can start viewing your data directly in the Lynq Dashboard.
